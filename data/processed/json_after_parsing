The information about registration of certified unmanned aircraft and of operators of unmanned aircraft that are subject to a registration requirement should be stored in digital harmonised interoperable national registration systems allowing competent authorities to access and exchange that informatioThe mechanisms to ensure the interoperability of the national registers in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the rules applicable to the future repository referred to in Article 74 of Regulation (EU) 2018/ In accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 this Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 including public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union la National registration systems should comply with the applicable Union and national law on privacy and processing of personal data and the information stored in those registrations systems should be easily accessible . UAS operators and remote pilots should ensure that they are adequately informed about applicable Union and national rules relating to the intended operations in particular with regard to safety privacy data protection liability insurance security and environmental protectio Some areas such as hospitals gatherings of people installations and facilities like penal institutions or industrial plants top-level and higher-level government authorities nature conservation areas or certain items of transport infrastructure can be particularly sensitive to some or all types of UAS operationThis should be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of this Regulation including environmental protection public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union la Unmanned aircraft noise and emissions should be minimised as far as possible taking into account the operating conditions and various specific characteristics of individual Member States such as the population density where noise and emissions are of concerIn order to facilitate the societal acceptance of UAS operations Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 includes maximum level of noise for unmanned aircraft operated close to people in the open categorIn the specific category there is a requirement for the operator to develop guidelines for its remote pilots so that all operations are flown in a manner that minimises nuisances to people and animal Current national certificates should be adapted to certificates complying with the requirements of this Regulatio In order to ensure the proper implementation of this Regulation appropriate transitional measures should be establisheIn particular Member States and stakeholders should have sufficient time to adapt their procedures to the new regulatory framework before this Regulation applie The new regulatory framework for UAS operations should be without prejudice to the applicable environmental and nature protection obligations otherwise stemming from national or Union la While the U-space system including the infrastructure services and procedures to guarantee safe UAS operations and supporting their integration into the aviation system is in development this Regulation should already include requirements for the implementation of three foundations of the U-space system namely registration geo-awareness and remote identification which will need to be further complete Since model aircraft are considered as UAS and given the good safety level demonstrated by model aircraft operations in clubs and associations there should be a seamless transition from the different national systems to the new Union regulatory framework so that model aircraft clubs and associations can continue to operate as they do today as well as taking into account existing best practices in the Member State In addition considering the good level of safety achieved by aircraft of class C4 as provided in Annex to this Regulation low risk operations of such aircraft should be allowed to be conducted in the open categorSuch aircraft often used by model aircraft operators are comparatively simpler than other classes of unmanned aircraft and should therefore not be subject to disproportionate technical requirement The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established in accordance with Article 127 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:"
